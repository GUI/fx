Description:
  Create a new database view for your application. This will create a new
  function definition file and the accompanying migration.

  When --no-migration is passed, skips generating a migration.

Examples:
    rails generate fx:view test

      create: db/views/test_v01.sql
      create: db/migrate/[TIMESTAMP]_create_test.rb
